The number of festivals is increasing by the year, but why are they becoming so popular?
Many people are attracted to the idea of a festival for a day out with good atmosphere and everyone enjoying something they love. Whether it
be food or music, if it is something you feel passionate about, a festival dedicated to it is right where you want to be!
The most popular type are music festivals, these tend to extend over a weekend or can just be for a day and are typically held annually in the
same place. Over the last 15 years the number of them in the UK has increased significantly. Holding the festival outdoors allows the event hosts
to sell large amounts of tickets. With lots of people attending there are a wide range of opportunities for sponsorship deals with big brands
where significant amounts of money can be generated for the event hosts. Artists also make a lot of money by performing at festivals and tend
to enjoy taking part to perform for large audiences as it can increase their recognition.
Global Music is a startup Concert / Festival Booking agency. They have asked you, initially, to create a prototype desktop application which will
eventually be available as a browser-based web application and a mobile app.



All customers then need to login so that they can edit their account details, view their previous bookings, view promoted concerts and festivals,
view the main bands involved, and make a booking for one or many people for a concert. Payment needs to be made at the same time as the
booking if made by the general public. There is no requirement to implement this in the initial prototype. Corporate organisations can be
invoiced by arrangement on a monthly basis. There will be a range of ticket prices (ie. A to C) for each concert – including a corporate price.
Only corporate organisations can choose this option. Customers cannot cancel a booking once made.
The system administration will be able to login to the system and view all available concerts/festivals, view all bookings, and confirm a booking
on receipt of payment. They will also need to invoice corporate organisations on a monthly basis.
The booking is for a concert/festival at a particular venue at a specific time.
A concert will have a number of bands, and each band will have an agent. The agent arranges the booking for the band at any particular
concert.
The festival organizer arranges promotion of the concert with Global Music’s booking agency. The festival organizer needs to be able to login to
the system and add concert details, edit concert details and cancel concerts when necessary.
Occasionally, a concert needs to be cancelled. All bookings for the concert are then cancelled automatically, and the customers and corporate
organisations are notified by the system administrator.
